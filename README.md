# Speedometer-arduino-uno
Speedometer project on arduino Uno board with ultrasonic sensor

Here is one of my project I did during my semester abroad at San Francisco State University.
The goal of this project was to create a speedometer using an Arduino uno board and an ultrasonic sensor and then displaying the velocity of the object on an lcd sreen.
You can also find on the pdf file how to wire your board and all the different components you need to recreate or improve this project!
